# Food Rescue App

## 🚀 Description

The **Food Rescue App** is a socially impactful platform designed to minimize food waste and combat hunger by connecting food donors with nearby NGOs, shelters, or individuals in need. Built with a user-centric approach, the app allows restaurants, event organizers, and households to easily list surplus food, while verified recipients can request and collect food based on real-time availability.

The platform includes role-based access for **Donors**, **Volunteers**, and **Receivers**, with smart geolocation matching to ensure efficient and timely food distribution. Users receive instant notifications when food is available nearby, and a built-in chat or helpline feature facilitates coordination.

Key features include:

* 📦 Easy food listing with photos and expiry tracking.
* 📍 Location-based matchmaking for pickups.
* 🔔 Real-time alerts for new donations.
* ✅ Food quality checklist to ensure safety.
* 📊 Analytics dashboard for NGOs and admins to track impact.

The backend is developed using **Node.js and Express**, with a **MongoDB database**, and the frontend is built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, ensuring a fast and responsive UI. The system is scalable, with future plans for AI-based spoilage prediction and automatic donor-recipient matching using ML.

This project demonstrates strong skills in full-stack development, problem-solving for real-world issues, and delivering a meaningful solution with technical and social value.
